Key points on functions

- unlike other languages, in go we could return multiple values simply separating them by commas
- any variables or constants that are defined in the function are scoped to that function
- we can add constant and variable declarations outside of any functions, directly into the code file
  and when we do that, that const or var is scoped to the entire code file instead of any function and hence
  is available in all the functions of that package.
