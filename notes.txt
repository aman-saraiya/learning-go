Notes on Interfaces
- An interface is essentially a contract, that gaurantees that a certain value
typically a struct has certain certain methods
- Note and Todo structs are very similar and we need to have the functionality 
to save the note and todo to a file, interfaces helps us use the same functions 
for such use cases and help reduce code duplication
- Unlike other programming languages we don't have to explicitly connect an 
interaface to some other type to force that type to adhere to that interface.
Instead Go reviews the value we pass in place of interface type and checks if 
that value (Note, Todo here) follows the interface contract.
