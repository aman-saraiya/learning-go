Notes on Structs

- Structs can be definied inside a function, but generally it is definied
outside of it, so that it is available across entire package
- We can start the struct name with a captial letter to allow it to be 
imported and used in other packages
- Functions attached to structs are called methods
- We can write constructor functions in go but that is just a coding
pattern followed in go, it is not a feature like methods baked into the 
Go language
- To use the variables/ functions/ struct etc from other packages their
name must start with a capital letter. Similarly, to have access to the fields
and methods of struct outside of the package we need to make the first letter
capital.
- It is common to name the constructor function as just `New`
- Struct embedding is used to build up new structs from existing structs, it is 
similar to inheritence in other Java/C++. Go doesn't have either classes or inheritence
