Key Points on Packages

- Every Go file must be a part of some package
- Multiple files can be a part of the same package
- Functions, Global Variables (package level variables) belonging to a 
  package can be used across all files of a package without any importing
- We could use more than one packages in our project for better organization 
  of codebase
- Every package must go into its own sub-folder, a single folder cannot have
  multiple packages
- To import a package in another package we need to specify the full path of the
  package to be imported
- Only functions and variables starting with capital letter are accessible in
  other packages via importing
- To use third party packages we need to use `go get <package-path>` to download
  the package, downloaded packages are added as dependencies in go.mod file
- `go get` without any package name downloads all the packages specified in the
  go.mod file
- A go module can contain multiple packages, most projects/applications have 
  only one module but they can have multiple modules
